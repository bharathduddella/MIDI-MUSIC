MIDI Matrix: WAV Based Music Generator using RNN
Project Overview:
MIDI Matrix is a WAV-based music generator utilizing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture. This project aims to generate music in WAV format by training a model on musical data, allowing the model to learn temporal patterns and generate sequences that resemble musical compositions.

Features:
Generates music in WAV format based on MIDI input data.
Uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence generation.
Models the temporal dependencies in music for realistic compositions.
Supports training on custom datasets of music.
Provides control over the output length and structure of the generated music.

Install dependencies:

The project requires the following libraries:

Python 3.7+
TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on the implementation)
Numpy
Librosa
Music21
Scipy
Matplotlib

Download MIDI Data:
You need to collect MIDI or WAV music data for training. Some useful datasets are:
Lakh MIDI Dataset
NES Music Database

Model Architecture
The music generation model is built using an RNN with LSTM/GRU layers to capture temporal dependencies. The architecture typically includes:

Input layer: Processed MIDI/WAV data
Recurrent Layers (LSTM/GRU): 2-3 layers for sequential data learning
Fully Connected Layer: To map RNN outputs to musical notes/tones
Output Layer: Produces a sequence of musical notes in WAV format
Training
The model is trained on MIDI data, converted into a sequence of note matrices. The training involves predicting the next note in a sequence, given a series of previous notes.

Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Optimizer: Adam
Batch Size: 32
Epochs: 50 (adjust as necessary based on your dataset)

Results
The generated WAV files resemble the original training data in style and structure.
Evaluations show that the model can generate coherent and structured music, though improvements can be made with longer training times and larger datasets.
